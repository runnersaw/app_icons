# App Icons

This repository contains app icons and Python code for generating these icons,
for use by app developers needing icons for their new applications.

All code and images are covered by the Unlicense, and considered released into
the public domain. This is intended as a resource for app developers to use
when creating new applications, as an alternative to paying for icons or being
required to include a license within your application.
